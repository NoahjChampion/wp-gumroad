Display your Gumroad purchase pages in a pretty lightbox or embed them right on your pages.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you bring in the Gumroad purchase pages right onto your site, so that transactions can happen inline â€” without ruining the browsing experience for your customers.

The overlay option pops up the purchase form in a pretty lightbox. See the official [Gumroad Overlay documentation](https://gumroad.com/overlay).

The embed option shows the purchase form directly on your page. See the official [Gumroad Embed documentation](https://gumroad.com/embed).

This plugin simply embeds a Gumroad JavaScript snippet on the posts or pages you specify. See the options along the right sidebar while editing a post or page.

You can also enable Gumroad on the home page or archive pages where multiple posts are shown. Just look under Settings in your WordPress dashboard.

= Troubleshooting =

[TODO this right?]

From the official [Gumroad overlay documentation](https://gumroad.com/overlay):

If the overlay doesn't get triggered on click (and your browser is redirected to a gumroad.com URL), please make sure that there is not extra code that is hijacking the click event (for example, a Google Analytics onclick event).

A popular known plugin that does this is **Google Analytics for WordPress**. Try unchecking one or both of these options: 1) Track outbound clicks & downloads, 2) Check Advanced Settings, then make sure "Track outbound clicks as pageviews" is un-checked.

Your theme must implement **wp_footer()** in the footer.php file, otherwise JavaScript will not load correctly. You can test if this is the issue by switching to a WordPress stock theme such as twenty-twelve temporarily.
